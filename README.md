# Exobike

An ASCII-art motorcycle racing game for <strike>the Commodore
Pet</strike> modern web browsers written in
<strike>BASIC</strike> Coffeescript.

## Compiling

1. Install node.js, coffeescript and GNU make.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Type 'make'.
4. Copy *.js and index.html to your web server.

## To do:

1. Speed mechanics need to be tuned.
2. Could probably benefit from some variant of the engine heat
   mechanic.
3. Motorcycle should be able to transform into power armor in order to
   fight ASCII Invid.
4. Needs a scoreboard; could probably fit it all in a cookie.
